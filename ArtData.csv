Unknown,------------,China,------------,Hill Jar,First-Third century CE; Eastern Han Dynasty,Glazed earthenware,Gift of Warren and Shirley King- 2012.12.07,Hill jars (zun) take their name from the mountain-shaped lid topping their cylindrical body. The swirling peaks and cavorting creatures that decorate the lid evoke the mystical domain inhabited by Daoist immortals a realm to which the deceased might ascend. In the Daoist tradition immortality was an achievement that could be attained through ritual practices. The drum like shape of the vessel's body derives from wine warmers and the greenish glaze mimics bronze when oxidized. The design of the lid is related to incense burners which similarly featured mountainous landscapes. These two vessel types are combined in hill jars creating a vessel that served a specifically funerary function.",1

The word comes from its cognate with Latin calix the source of the English word "chalice. CUAM's kylix (2006.35) is an undecorated black gloss vessel that represents the type of decoration used for the majority of pottery that circulated in the ancient world. More ornate kylikes were typically decorated with scenes related to mythology or the symposium. The shallow bowl of the kylix is specifically designed to ease drinking while reclining on one's side during a symposium. The wide handles also allow the symposiasts to play kottabos a drinking game wherein players help one handle of the kylix with their pointer finger swinging the vessel to fling dregs of wine at each other.,1

These vessels primarily held perfumed oil sprinkled during funerary rituals to cover the smell of the deceased. While CUAM's lekythos measures 6 1/4 inches tall the interior space was only as wide as the neck and extended only an inch below the shoulder of the vessel. Because of this funerary association lekythoi- created in monumental scale and devoid of their original function - became popular as grave markers when large elaborate stone makers went out of fashion during the Early and High Classical periods.,1
